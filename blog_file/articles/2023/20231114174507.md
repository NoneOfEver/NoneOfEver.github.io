## Does Working Hard Really Make You a Good Person? |Azim Shariff

--

Your employer give you two options : either you can keep getting paid as per your contract , but stay home as the software does your job or keep on working as automated for the same money .

Most of your , I am sure , you will take the money , stay home ,watch TED talks .

No-brainer

What do we thought of Jeff , who kept working .

Even though Jeff added no extra values , people saw him as virtuous for choosing to keep plugging away .

Recently AS’s collaborators and him have been working on work itself .

Find that people attach moral worth to effort .

Let two workers produce same widgets , if make you choose one of them as your partner , you will choose the harder one .

The hard working person was seen as more moral .

Now effort moralization makes sense at the individual level .

In instance , Paul is an uncommonly charismatic man . In one of Paul’s running morning ,he saw Paul struggling in an inelegant hobble . Running is hard for him . Every morning is effort . The evolutionary psychologists call this partner choice . Just as we are trying be and select the best romantic partners .

scaled up to the societal level .

How many Jeff out there , who taking time that could have been spent on love or leisure ? And how often are we Jeff ?

Workaholism

Partner choice is not just about being a good cooperation partner , but about being a better cooperation partner than the next guy . Not hard working , but harder working .

The culture punishes us for not keeping up .

But how much of the effort we spend now is done to build nothing , but our own moral reputations . And how much of what we admire in others is just effort porn ？

If all we ask from each other is the effort that we put in , then we will create a world full of effort and of hard labor and of cobras . But if what we ask from each other is to produce something meaningful , we will create a world full of meaning . And what could be more moral than that ?
